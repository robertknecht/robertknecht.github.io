Bowling score keeper

Just choose your scores for each frame from the drop downs and watch this program track your score in a nice format.

For some reason, GitHub's live web hosting for this project doesn't like the PHP requests, but you can see a live demo of this code at https://farminthedellrrv.dreamhosters.com/bowling/robertknecht.github.io/
